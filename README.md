# Codeclose

## A license system and code obfuscator for Python

This is the main repository of Codeclose, and this document is intended to its maintainers.

If you want to **use** Codeclose, you will find more information in its [official website](https://juanlao7.github.io/codeclose/).

## Under construction

This project was born as the license system of [Protopipe](https://juanlao7.github.io/protopipe_web/) but then I thought that it may help someone else, so I decided to separate it into another repository and publish it as an open source tool under the MIT License.

In the commit history of this repository you will find weird commit messages, because they originally belonged to Protopipe's repository. You will also find that there are no tests, and the reason is that I invested most of my time developing a suite for testing the obfuscated \& encrypted version of Protopipe. If made the assumption that if Protopipe worked fine, then Codeclose works too.

I am currently not developing this project, but if you find any bug or you have a feature request, I will probably find time to fix or implement it. Feel free to use [the issue tracker](https://github.com/juanlao7/codeclose/issues) or [contact me](https://juanlao7.github.io/codeclose/contact).
